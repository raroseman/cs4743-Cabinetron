Josef Klein and Ryan Roseman

Requirements implementation:

Note to TA: We talked to Professor Robinson about the graph for merging GUI_Implementation. He told us that the issue was from a fast-forward merge and he could tell that the branch was created and developed on. He instructed us to let you know not to count off since reversing the merge would cause issues. Please speak with him regarding any questions. Thank you, Ryan and Joe.
